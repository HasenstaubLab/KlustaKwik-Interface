0. Install python/an older version of the whole Klustasuite.
This will install the python environment you need to run Klustasuite, as well as all 3 components of the Suite.

1. Install most recent Klustaviewa by double clicking klustaviewa-0.3.0.rc1.win-amd64-py2.7
This fixes a bug in the suite, but the installer doesnÕt include python/key components of the klustasuite, necessitating step 0. When you run the installation, the installer will run, then close. It will have updated a bunch of files in your Klustasuite folders, but wonÕt automatically open any applications or really give you any indication that it has worked. But it probably has. 

KlustaKwik has a bug: it ignores the parameters given in the params file in favor of default parameters. This is only a problem when dealing with large datasets, as high values of the parameter maskstarts (which determines in the initial number of clusters the program assumes will exist) causes the program to hang. A workaround: compile KlustaKwik v0.3.0 from source, altering the default parameters.

2. Using a program such as Visual Studio Express 2013, compile klustakwik-0.3.0.rc3. Use the Release 64x version, providing thatÕs appropriate for your computer. 
The parameters.h file included in the folder has already been updated to assume a starting point of 64 distinct clusters with a maximum of 100. To change these defaults again, open parameters.h, and alter the following lines:


  F("Run Mask starts with this many starting clusters",                      \
      INT_PARAM,   MaskStarts,            integer MaskStarts,            64      )\

 F("Maximum possible number of clusters to be used after splitting.",       \
      INT_PARAM,     MaxPossibleClusters, integer MaxPossibleClusters,   100     )\

You then need to copy all the files generated in the x64>Release folder into the klusta program files folder. The folder should be on the following path: Program Files> KlustaViews>WinPython-64big-2.7.6.4>python-2.7.6amd64>Scripts. Just dump all the files generated by Visual studio into that Scripts folder. 


After these steps, you should be good to go. Please see the User Guide on how to run data.
