1. Install python/KlustaSuite by double clicking klustaviewa-0.3.0.rc1.win-amd64-py2.7
	This will install the python environment you need to run Klustasuite, as well as all 3 components of the Suite.

KlustaKwik has a bug – it ignores the parameters given in the params file in favor of default parameters. This is only a problem when dealing with large datasets, as high values of the parameter ‘maskstarts’ (which determines in the initial number of clusters the program assumes will exist) causes the program to hang. A workaround: compile KlustaKwik v0.3.0 from source, altering the default parameters.

2. Using a program such as Visual Studio Express 2013, compile klustakwik-0.3.0.rc3. The parameters.h file included in the folder has already been updated to assume a starting point of 64 distinct clusters with a maximum of 100. To change these defaults again, open parameters.h, and alter the following lines:


  F("Run Mask starts with this many starting clusters",                      \
      INT_PARAM,   MaskStarts,            integer MaskStarts,            64      )\

 F("Maximum possible number of clusters to be used after splitting.",       \
      INT_PARAM,     MaxPossibleClusters, integer MaxPossibleClusters,   100     )\

After these steps, you should be good to go. Please see the User Guide on how to run data.
